# Cocktailr

## What is Cocktailr?

**Cocktailr** is an application that allows cocktail lovers to **discover new cocktails** and **find cocktails** based on the **ingredients** they have or want to use.

This project was originally created for my thesis about [Flutter vs. other mobile development frameworks](https://medium.com/in-the-pocket-insights/flutter-versus-other-mobile-development-frameworks-a-ui-and-performance-experiment-abf9e2f3475f). It was also my entry for the [Flutter Create](https://flutter.dev/create) contest. The Android app is available in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bramdeconinck.cocktailr&hl=en_US).

## What's next?

I've been working with Flutter for nearly 2 years but I still learn new things every week. That's why I keep thinking  and I come up with new ideas for this project. I keep on improving and refining Cocktailr and it will probably never truly be 'done'. I've made a list of features I still want to add and chores I have to do, but feel free to leave any suggestions if you have them.

- Write unit tests
- Add proper error handling
- Add a dialog service
- Set up proper pipelines on Codemagic for beta and release builds
- Add web support
- Add empty state screens
- Add a connectivity checker
- Splash screen
- New app icon
- More animations
- Add a Rive animation (splash screen?)
- Setting for switching between lists and grids
- Let cards 'snap' in horizontal scrolling lists
- Find a way to convert measures like oz to cl
- Add detail screen for ingredients
- Onboarding screens
- Optional authentication
